# US Housing Market Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the US housing market over the past 20 years and build a data science model to understand their impact on home prices. The S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index serves as a proxy for home prices.

## Dataset

The primary dataset is sourced from the [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) platform, focusing on key factors such as unemployment rate, GDP, income, construction data, consumer indices, and more. The dataset spans from [Specific Start Date] to [Specific End Date].

## Project Roadmap

### 1. Problem Understanding
   - Understand the problem statement and objectives.

### 2. Data Collection
   - Search for relevant blogs and resources.
   - Compile data from public websites for key factors.

### 3. Data Preparation
   - Combine individual datasets for selected factors.
   - Handle missing values and ensure consistency.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
   - Visualize trends and relationships in the data.

### 5. Model Building
   - Build linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.
   - Evaluate and compare model performance.

### 6. Feature Importance
   - Use SHAP values to explain feature importance.
   - Visualize and interpret the impact of features on home prices.

### 7. Cross-Validation
   - Assess model performance using cross-validation.
   - Compare mean CV scores for each model.

### 8. Model Selection
   - Consider various metrics (R2, MSE, etc.) for model selection.
   - Choose the best-performing model for deployment.

### 9. Model Deployment
   - Save the selected model for future use.
